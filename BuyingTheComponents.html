  <h3>Before you can start to build your very own PC, you need to buy all the components needed, and of course some
    accesories if you want it to look nice and pretty. There are so many different recommendations and types of each component but here
    are some we would recomend, along with their uses for the computer.</h3>
</div>
<p style="font-size:130%;">The main 6 Components you need to build your very own PC are: </p>
<ol style="font-size:120%;">
  <li><a href="#section-1">Case</a><br /></li>
  <li><a href="#section-2">Motherboards</a><br /></li>
  <li><a href="#section-3">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</a><br /></li>
  <li><a href="#section-4">Memory (RAM)</a><br /></li>
  <li><a href="#section-5">Storage</a><br /></li>
  <li><a href="#section-6">Power Supply (PSU)</a><br /></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="section-1">Case</h2>
    <p>
      The case is what keeps your build from getting dusty and destroyed, a.k.a. it keeps it safe.
      The case is what makes your PC your own, you can fully customize it and you can choose any colour
      you want from red, to yellow, to rainbow, to black.
      You can buy different cases from many different shops, but if you need a head start on some case ideas heres a few.
    </p>

<h2 id="section-2">Motherboards</h2>
    <p>
      Establish a budget for your PC. Matt Ham points out that it's too easy to start buying attractive
      parts without sticking to a budget, only to realize that you're out of money and don't have all of
      the necessary equipment to build your PC. Figure out a soft limit (e.g., $300) and a hard limit
      ( e.g., $400) and try to stay within that range.
      Common sense should guide your purchasing as well.
      For example, if the processor for which you budget is $100 but a nicer, newer model is discounted
      from $200 to $120 at your local tech store, spending the extra $20 is probably a better long-term
      investment.

<h2 id="section-3">Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
  <p>
    Learn the basics about each part you have to buy. No matter how expensive your computer is, you will need the following components for your project:[2]
    Processor (CPU) — This is the "brain" of your computer. In most builds, the CPU is the second-most expensive component.
    CPU Cooler — The CPU requires dedicated cooling to avoid overheating. You can use an air cooler, which is cheaper, or an AIO (all-in-one) cooler that uses antifreeze to liquid cool the chip.
    Motherboard — This serves as the interface between all of your computer's components and the processor. It’s sort of like the foundation of a home.
    RAM — Random Access Memory. RAM increases your computer's performance by handling short-term memory and data storage. The more RAM you have, the more complex tasks your computer can perform.
    Storage Drives (HDD or SSD) — These store data. You can buy a traditional hard disk drive (HDD), or a slightly more expensive solid-state drive (SSD). These days, SSDs are relatively cheap and usually worth the extra spend.
    Power supply — This powers all of your computer's individual components. This is what you plug into the wall socket.
    Graphics card (GPU) — This renders images on your computer. Ham explains that while most processors have a built-in graphics processing unit (GPU), buying a dedicated graphics card is essential if you plan on doing anything beyond web browsing.
    Fans — This includes case fans and coolers for specific parts and keeps the inside of your case at a safe temperature.
    Case — This is necessary for storing and cooling your components.

<h2 id="section-4">Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p>

      Use PC Part Picker to craft your components list as you go. PC Part Picker is basically essential these days. It allows PC builders to list the components they want to buy so that they confirm everything is compatible.
      The site also allows you to track the prices of each component so you can ensure you get the best deal.[3]
      As you choose the components you want, add them to your build. If you ever change your mind, just swap the piece out on your list and reconfirm the build is compatible (PC Part Picker will tell you if it isn’t).
      PC Part Picker is 100% free.
      PC Part Picker is also a great place to start if you have zero idea which RAM cards you want or which CPU is ideal, etc. The site pulls performance data and component popularity for every potential component.

<h2 id="section-5">Storage</h2>
    <p>Buy your components over time to get the best deal. In-store locations such as Best Buy will stock computer components, but you can usually find comparable parts for cheaper if you shop online. Common online locations include Amazon, eBay, and NewEgg. If you want the best prices, wait for sales on the individual component in your list—you’d be surprised how often parts go on sale.
      Waiting for sales (e.g. Black Friday Sales) can often pay off, as parts can be heavily discounted, allowing you to either save money or opt for better components for the same price.
      Some online retailers may offer a 'free shipping' deal if you spend a certain amount of money. Consider buying enough parts from those sites to save on shipping, which is often expensive. This doesn't mean you should pay more for components cheaper elsewhere though!
