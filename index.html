    <h3>Why build your own PC?</h3>
    <p>When deciding between a pre-built computer and building your own, it’s important to consider your needs,
      budget, and goals. Both options have their advantages, but building your own PC often offers greater
      flexibility and value.
    <br>Pre-built computers come fully assembled and ready to use, making them a convenient choice for those
      who prefer a hassle-free experience. They’re often sold by major manufacturers like Dell, HP, or Lenovo,
      and typically include warranties covering the entire system. However, pre-built PCs can have limitations.
      The components are often less customizable, and manufacturers sometimes use parts that can be challenging to
      upgrade or replace.
    <br>Building your own computer puts you in the driver’s seat. You have complete control over every component,
      from the processor to the case design, allowing you to tailor your PC to fit your exact needs. A custom build
      often delivers better performance for the price since you can avoid markups and choose components that offer
      the best value. Plus, the ability to upgrade specific parts over time ensures your PC remains relevant and
      powerful for years to come.</p>
