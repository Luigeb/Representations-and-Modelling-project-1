    <h2>The Tutorial</h2>
    <p>We can all get overwhelmed trying something new, and with the amount of steps when it comes to building
      your own PC it's easy to get scared. There is a Video attached from the Youtube Channel
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXaLc9AYIcg">TechSource</a> which will help anyone new to this
      who may need visual help in addition to these easy-to-follow steps.</p>
    <p>These next few steps will outline the necessary precautions, required tools and the general "how-to" on
      building your own computer.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Plan Ahead</h2>
    <p>Prepare your tools and lay out your needed <a href="BuyingTheComponents.html">components</a>.
      First, we will need an assortment of screwdriver bits both large and small to accommodate the intricate,
      delicate parts as well as the larger, sturdier components such as the case itself. A necessary screwdriver is a
      Phillips head, and it may be ideal to screw many of the parts in manually as an electric screwdriver may cause damage to the PC.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Stress Free</h2>
    <p>Ensure your workspace is clear of any liquids, and overall clutter. Clutter can cause you to lose small components
      necessary such as bits, screws or even chips. A liquid spill could easily damage the integrity of any electronic part. </p>
    <h2>Step 3: CPU To Motherboard</h2>
    <p>Finally beginning the process, you will start with your CPU and Motherboard. Using the RYZEN AM4 Chip as an example, which has pins
      on the underside. Release the tension lever alongside the socket, raise the retention frame, pop off the protective cover,
      find the matching arrow, and align your processor with the arrow before dropping it into the socket. </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Memory to Motherboard</h2>
    <p>While this next step is generally done with the motherboard mounted to the PC Case, as a beginner it would be much simpler to
      install it in a clear view outside of the case. On the motherboard there will be 4 long slots, with 'levers' on either side of each
      slot. Click open the levers, then pick up your memory stick and insert it into one of the open slots. The levers will then
      latch onto the memory stick, locking it in place. Picture Credit: Joseph Maldonado.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: SSD To Motherboard</h2>
    <p>While hard drives are still used, SSDs are much more popular due to their speed. First you will want to find the optimal slot
      in your motherboard, as it will effect the speed of your SSD. It's ideal for it to be connected directly to the CPU M2 slot.
      The slot may be open or covered with a heatcover, which must be carefully unscrewed. Once uncovered, insert the SSD at an angle until
      a click is heard. The SSD should then stand at a 45 degree angle due to the tension springs. Always remember to screw the heat cover
      back onto your motherboard. Picture Credit: Joseph Maldonado.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Motherboard To Case</h2>
    <p>First, remove a side panel from your PC Case. This can be done through latches at the bottom, or screws. Place your case on it's side
      facing up, for a clear view of its interior. The back panel of your case will have standoffs, premade holes with screws to attach our
      motherboard to. You may have to remove some of the screws as the motherboard will need to lay flat, and make sure there are none that
      can damage your motherboard. This will lineup with the I/O Shield, which will allow you to plug in all your cables later on.
      It may be easier to install the I/O Shield prior to the motherboard for a clear line of sight and installation.</p>
    <h2>Step 7: Wiring</h2>
    <p>This step will require you to mostly follow your part's manual, but remember that positive pins must meet positive pins and
      vice versa, as is most important for the LED wiring.</p>
    <h2>Step 8: CPU Cooler & Radiator</h2>
    <p>Attach a Bracket onto either the bottom, or inner front side of your PC case for each fan/liquid cooler you will use. Using fans as
      an example, you will generally get a preset bracket fitting the air cooling system you may receive with your case. You may need to
      apply thermal paste if it hasn't already been applied. Spread the paste over a thin layer and wipe off any excess. The last part of
    this step is to connect your air cooler into the motherboard, which will generally only be one cable unless it includes LED components.
