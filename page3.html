  <div class="dropdown">

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('everyday-use')">Everyday Use</button>
      <div id="everyday-use" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Ideal for daily tasks like browsing, shopping, and streaming your favorite shows. A powerful computer will not be needed, we would recommend a pretty basic build. Intel I3, 4-8GB of ram and 500GB hard drive. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('business')">Business</button>
      <div id="business" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Designed for productivity with better performance for office tasks, projects, and more. For a smooth working experience we would recommend an Intel I5, 8-16GB of ram and a 500GB SSD.</p>

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('gaming')">Gaming</button>
      <div id="gaming" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Built to deliver high performance for gaming with advanced graphics and speed. More money will need to be spent as games require good parts in order to have a good performance. We would recommend a last generation Intel I5 or a Intel I7, 16-32GB of ram, 1TB SSD and a powerful graphics card.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">

    <!-- Heading 2 : Operating System -->
  </div>
  <div class="text-box">
  <h1>Operating System (OS)</h1>
  <p>The operating system manages your software and changes how it looks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dropdown">

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('macOS')">macOS</button>
      <div id="macOS" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Operating system built by apple and its exclusive to Mac desktops and laptops. It has a stylised interface and is an accessible and stable option. We recommend this operating system for people who already own apple products and for those who just want a casual use of a computer. It is important to note that macOS does not support some software that is available for windows.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('windows')">Windows</button>
      <div id="windows" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Most popular operating system. Although its interface is not as easy and simple to use as macOS it still proves to be straightforward to use. Most software are built to work on windows so any software that you might desire is likely to be stable on windows.  </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('linux')">Linux</button>
      <div id="linux" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Linux is recommended for more advanced users asLinux frequently requires command-line interfaces for certain duties, such as software installation and system configuration. There is no restrictions on how you use it, anyone can run and modify the operating system for their own purposes. Software and applications are not readily accessible as developers concentrate on creating applications for Windows and macOS. Similarly to software, games do not support Linux so keep this in mind when selecting your operating system. </p>
      </div>

  <!-- Heading 3 : Processor -->
 <div class="text-box">
   <h1>Processor</h1>
   <p>Processor is the heart of the computer and The more powerful the processor, the faster the computer can complete its tasks</p>
 </div>

  <div class="dropdown">

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('clock-speed')">Clock Speed</button>
      <div id="clock-speed" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Clock speed in a CPU is like the speed limit for how fast it can process tasks. Measured in GHz (gigahertz), it shows how many operations a core can handle per second. A higher clock speed means the CPU can work through tasks more quickly, which helps programs run faster and makes your computer feel more responsive.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('Cores')">Cores</button>
      <div id="Cores" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Cores in a CPU are like individual workers in a team. Each core can handle its own task, so the more cores a CPU has, the more tasks it can manage at the same time. This makes it easier to run multiple programs, handle complex software, or process large amounts of data efficiently. Essentially, more cores mean your computer can do more without slowing down.  </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('Intel-AMD')">Intel or AMD</button>
      <div id="Intel-AMD" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>AMD and Intel are two major brands of CPUs, each with its strengths. AMD is known for offering great value, especially for multitasking and gaming, thanks to its high core counts. Intel, on the other hand, often excels at single-core performance, which can make it slightly better for tasks that depend on speed, like certain games or software.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Heading 4 : Storage -->
  <div class="text-box">
    <h1>Storage</h1>
    <p>Storage in a computer is where all your data is saved, like your files, photos, apps, and even the operating system. In computer HDDs and SSDs are used to store your files.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dropdown">

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('HDD')">Hard Disc Drive (HDD)</button>
      <div id="HDD" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>A hard disc drive is the most common type of desktop PC storage. It is cheaper but it is slower than a SSD</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('SSD')">Solid-state Drive (SSD)</button>
      <div id="SSD" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>SSDs work much faster than Hard Drives, making them ideal for running demanding software or the latest games but they are more expensive.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Heading 5 : GPU -->
  <div class="text-box">
    <h1>Graphics Card</h1>
    <p>A Graphics Card takes the job of processing images, videos, and 3D graphics, so your computer’s main processor (CPU) doesn’t get overloaded and does it more efficiently aswell.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dropdown">

    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('Functionality')">Do I need a dedicated graphics card?</button>
      <div id="Functionality" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>If you’re gaming, editing videos, working with 3D design, or doing other graphic-intensive tasks, a dedicated graphics card is a must for better performance. Otherwise the integrated graphics card in a CPU will do.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-item">
      <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('Nvidia-AMD')">Nvidia or AMD</button>
      <div id="Nvidia-AMD" class="dropdown-content">
        <p>Nvidia and AMD are the two main brands for graphics cards, and both are great for gaming and creative work. Nvidia is known for its advanced features like ray tracing and DLSS, which improve graphics quality and performance, especially in high-end games. AMD often provides better value for the price, offering solid performance and more memory for the money. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Heading 6 : Ram Memory -->
  <div class="text-box">
    <h1>Memory</h1>
    <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is like the short-term memory of your computer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dropdown">

  <div class="dropdown-item">
    <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('RAM-Functionality')">What does it do?</button>
    <div id="RAM-Functionality" class="dropdown-content">
      <p>It temporarily stores data that the CPU is actively using, so it can access it quickly. The more RAM you have, the more tasks and programs your computer can handle at once without slowing down.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="dropdown-item">
    <button class="dropdown-button" onclick="toggleDropdown('RAM-Required')">How much ram do I need?</button>
    <div id="RAM-Required" class="dropdown-content">
      <p>For basic tasks like browsing the web and using office apps, 8GB of RAM is usually enough. If you're into gaming or doing things like photo and video editing, 16GB is a good choice for smooth performance. For more demanding tasks like 3D design or heavy multitasking, 32GB or more may be needed</p>
